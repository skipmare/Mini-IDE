# Mini-IDE ðŸ’»
*A C++ project for automata, regex to ENFA/DFA conversion, and state machine simulation.*

## ðŸ“– Overview
**Mini-IDE** is a C++ implementation of core concepts from **automata theory**.  
It provides functionality to parse **regular expressions**, convert them into **Îµ-NFA (ENFA)**, transform them into **DFA**, and manage states and transitions.  
The project also supports configuration via `.ini` files and includes an HTML converter for output visualization.

## Features
- Convert **regular expressions** into ENFA  
- Transform **ENFA â†’ DFA**  
- Manage states, groups, and transition tables  
- Configurable with `.ini` files  
- Export results to HTML
